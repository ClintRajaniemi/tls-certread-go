# tls-certread-go
Application that reads TLS certificates from the TLS handshake and outputs them to file in JSON format. This was built to identify when TLS certificates would expire.
Since it pulls the entire TLS certificate, it will have uses beyond this.
This is a quick and simple tool that hasn't been tested in nearly two years.
